### Situated
_adjective_
1. located; placed
2. In cognitive science, referring to an agent that is in an environment.

Situated is a blog by [Sean Voisen](https://sean.voisen.org). It's mostly a place for me to think out loud about software engineering management, as well as software design and its impact on society. It's a blog about technology _in context_. You'll likely find me ruminating about things like building a better web, privacy, digital minimalism, improving the culture, ethics and management of software engineering, or just some book I enjoyed recently.
