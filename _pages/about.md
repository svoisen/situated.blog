### Situated
_adjective_
1. located; placed
2. In cognitive science, referring to an agent that is in an environment.

Situated is a blog by [Sean Voisen](https://seanvoisen.com). It's mostly a place for me to think out loud about software design and its impact on human productivity and creative expression. It's a blog about “situated software,” software-as-it-is-used, technology _in context_. You'll likely find me ruminating about things like human-computer interaction, accessibility, social computing, ethical design, building a better web, engineering management, or some book I enjoyed recently.

Writing here is intentionally informal, back-of-the-notebook kind of writing that may be full of uninformed first impressions or mistakes. I welcome a skeptical eye, and if you have comments you can [find me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/svoisen).
