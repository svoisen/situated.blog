### Situated
_adjective_
1. located; placed
2. In cognitive science, referring to an agent that is in an environment.

Situated is a blog by [Sean Voisen](https://sean.voisen.org). It's mostly a place for me to think out loud about software, and the contexts in which it is created and deployed. You'll likely find me blathering about things like building a better web, improving the culture, ethics and management of software engineering, or just some book I enjoyed recently.

I'm a father of two small children. Spare time is precious and updates will be sporadic. Bear with me.
