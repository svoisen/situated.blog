### Situated
_adjective_
1. located; placed
2. In cognitive science, referring to an agent that is in an environment.

Situated is a blog by [Sean Voisen](https://sean.voisen.org). It's mostly a place for me to think out loud about software design and its impact on humanity. It's a blog about software-in-the-world, technology _in context_. You'll likely find me ruminating about things like building a better web, human-computer interaction, accessibility, social computing, ethical design, engineering management practices, or just some book I enjoyed recently.

Writing here is intentionally informal, back-of-the-notebook kind of writing that may be full of uninformed first impressions or mistakes. I welcome a skeptical eye, and if you have comments you can [find me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/svoisen).
